# Art

Art or the arts is a sacred language and gift that allows a person to express himself in such a way that a 
person uses it to translate the feelings and struggles that are contained in his essential self, and not an 
expression of his need for requirements in his life, although some scholars consider art as life the necessity for men, such as water and food.
Art is a gift and creativity gifted by the Creator to every human being, but in degrees that vary between the individual and the other. 
So that we cannot classify all people as artists except for those who are distinguished by their tremendous creative ability. 
The word art is an indication of the skills used to produce things that carry aesthetic value.
